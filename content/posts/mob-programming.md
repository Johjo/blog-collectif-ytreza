# Genesis
At the very beginning, each developer was behind his own computer in his garage or whatever room they liked to be in. There were very few of them because affording a computer was far from how easy it is today.

Years passed and companies started to show needs for software development. Developers were hired to work on projects in the same place. Development became a team activity. Hurray !

These developers had to organize their work in a way they would be efficient by :  

- storing file in shared hard disk
- sharing code with source version tools (subversion, mercurial, tortoise svn, cvs)
- sharing code with git
- making pull request (first for OSS projects then for all projects)

All of these had a problem, if two people work on the same thing, they can

....


Tous ces concepts étaient complexes pour partager le travail d'équipe. Un jour, quelqu'un a eu l'idée de simplifier ce process en faisant travailler les développeurs ensemble, sur le même clavier et le même écran. Le mob programming était né.

Et enfin, avec Internet, le remote mob programming a vu le jour.

But did it really ?
